# GDBViews



Code for views in graph database system (Neo4j). Refer to this readme as a summary, with method overview in a separate readme for each respective directory, along with details commented in the code itself.
  
Main:
The main program, which opens a simple terminal for creating and using views with the extended language. Contains the node and edge tables.

QueryParser: 
The parser for the tree generated by View.g4. Used to set up meta-data and update the dependency table when parsing a query. This also uses TableEntry and EntryData which make up the dependency table.

Neo4jGraphConnector:
The interface for the connection between the application and the local Neo4j database. A config file is required to create the database. Contains methods which return node and edge identifiers.

Test files:
All test methods are included inside the main program. For materialized views there is the automatic re-writing using node identifiers, and for non-materialized views, there is no automatic rewriting, but it is described in text. Likewise for the baseline queries they are hard-coded. 

Jess:
All methods or files that use or mention Jess were used when exploring discrimination networks (rule-based systems) to deal with materialized views, which offered an incremental view update. This also includes GraphEngine, NodeEnum, EdgeEnum, and any rule files in the /jess/ directory. However, the space complexity was too high and we abandoned the idea. 

Other:
MetaData and ViewQueryListener are part of old versions of the parser which used a "view atoms" concept to detect outdated views. They serve no purpose now.
